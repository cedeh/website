This is an R Markdown file, a plain text file that has the extension `.Rmd`. You can download a copy [here](demos/1-example.Rmd).

Notice that the file contains three types of content:

* An (optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`s
* R code chunks surrounded by <code>```</code>s
* text mixed with simple text formatting

## A Notebook Interface

When you open the file in the RStudio IDE, it becomes a [notebook interface for R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html). You can run each code chunk by clicking the ![](images/notebook-run-chunk.png) icon. RStudio executes the code and display the results inline with your file.

## Rendering output

To generate a report from the file, run the `render` command:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
render("1-example.Rmd")
```

Better still, use the "Knit" button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or keyboard shortcut (&#8679;&#8984;K).

R Markdown generates a new file that contains selected text, code, and results from the .Rmd file. The new file can be a finished [web page](html_document_format.html), [PDF](pdf_document_format.html), [MS Word](word_document_format.html) document, [slide show](ioslides_presentation_format.html), [notebook](r_notebooks.html), [handout](tufte_handout_format.html), [book](https://bookdown.org/), [dashboard](flexdashboard/index.html), [package vignette](package_vignette_format.html) or [other format](formats.html).

## How it works

![](lesson-images/RMarkdownFlow.png)
</br>

When you run `render`, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and it's output.

The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) which is responsible for creating the finished format.

This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single `render` function.
